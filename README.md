# GRAPH-GUIDED NETWORK FOR IRREGULARLY SAMPLED MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES

Here we show all datasets (P19, P12, and PAM) used in our work,  and implementation codes for the proposed Raindrop model and all baselines. Some data files are not uploaded here due to size limitations, we will add downloadable links later.

We will also add more details including descriptions of datasets and scripts, configuration, instruction for regenerating our results, miscellaneous, etc.
